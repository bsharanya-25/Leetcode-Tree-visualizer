## LeetCode Tree Visualizer (Frontend)

This LeetCode tree visualizer frontend is designed to enhance the understanding and visualization of binary trees while solving tree-related problems on LeetCode. It allows users to construct binary trees visually, making it easier to debug and test algorithms.

### How It Works:

1. **Input Tree Structure**: Users input the tree structure using a user-friendly interface, specifying the value of each node and its connection to other nodes (left child, right child).

2. **Visualization**: The input tree structure is translated into a visual representation using HTML/CSS and JavaScript.

3. **Integration with Algorithms**: Users can integrate the visualizer with their tree algorithms to debug and visualize the execution of their code step by step.


### Features:

- Simple and intuitive user interface for constructing binary trees.
- Real-time visualization of the constructed tree structure.
- Interactive features to enhance user experience and understanding.
- Compatibility with popular browsers and LeetCode's coding environment.

### Technologies Used:

- HTML, CSS for the structure and styling of the visualizer.
- Interactive features to enhance user experience and understanding, powered by JavaScript and React.js.
- Integration with LeetCode's platform for seamless usage while solving problems.
